🌿 Project Overview

GreenLoop is a community-driven platform where eco-conscious people discover and join sustainability challenges, share practical eco-tips, browse local green events, and track personal environmental impact. The platform focuses on measurable progress and collective action by turning small everyday changes into community-wide impact.

🔥 Key Features

Join & Create Challenges — Participate in short- and long-term sustainability challenges (e.g., zero-waste week, bike-to-work month) and create your own challenges for others to join.

Personal Impact Tracking — Track measurable metrics such as CO₂ saved, water conserved, or waste reduced with simple, user-friendly logging and automatic summaries.

Community Tips & Guides — Share and browse practical, tested eco-tips; upvote and save favorites to your personal toolkit.

Local Events & Meetups — Discover nearby green events, volunteer opportunities, and workshops filtered by distance, date, and topic.

Progress Boards & Groups — Form or join local groups, view public progress leaderboards, and celebrate community milestones.

🚀 Why GreenLoop?

GreenLoop is built to make sustainable choices easier and more measurable. By combining individual tracking with community challenges and local events, the platform turns awareness into action and small changes into measurable environmental benefits.
